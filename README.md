#### Todo List with tasks:
There are 2 icons/buttons next to each task. These allow user to:
* edit task - when pencil icon is clicked, item to be edited disappears from the task list and the add task button changes to the green edit button, the user is able then to update the task in the input field
* remove the task from the list
* user can also click on the todo item and the item will be marked as complete
